    <p>It is said that dogs are human's best friend.They are loving, caring and most importanly they are loyal.It’s literally the best feeling when you come home after a hard day, and there’s a big waggy tail there to greet you.According to a recent survey, dog owners are more likely to be healthier overall because of their increased level of activity.</p>
