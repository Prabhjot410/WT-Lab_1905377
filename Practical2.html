            <td>These dogs love to meet new people, are good with kids, and although they require regular exercise, they don’t necessarily need a yard or a ton of space – they’re great city dogs.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Labrador Retriever</td>
            <td>Labs are one of the best dogs for families – known for their ability to socialize with children, other dogs, other animals, and strangers alike. These dogs love to play, have a pretty high energy level, and can be trained very easily.</td>
